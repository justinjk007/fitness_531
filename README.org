** App icons are made like this

For i-OS
https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_launcher_icons

For Android
Icons are made with Android Studio, so they look native based on android versions . [[https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive.html][Adaptive icons]]

On android, every size of the splash screen image name
=ic_launcher.png= is just the raw image(same size), just so the icon
splash screen is bigger.

** To get firebase config

For Android: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/fitness-531/settings/general/android:com.kaipada.fitness_531
- put the =json= file under android/app/google-services.json
