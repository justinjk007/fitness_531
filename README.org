* 5/3/1 Fitness

#+html:<a href="https://codemagic.io/apps/5e5556c356d57900193af386/5e5556c356d57900193af385/latest_build"><img src="https://api.codemagic.io/apps/5e5556c356d57900193af386/5e5556c356d57900193af385/status_badge.svg" /></a>

I wrote the app to learn flutter mostly, also the app allows me to
track my 5/3/1 Boring But Big Strength Training Regimen. If you want to
build this for yourself get your own firebase account, which is free
upto 1 GB of data.

** Icons I should pay respects too
- https://icons8.com/icon/38915/deadlift
- https://icons8.com/icon/13386/bench-press
- https://icons8.com/icon/16962/squats
- https://icons8.com/icon/16971/weightlifting

Main icon: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/barbell_1690609#term=barbell&page=1&position=23

SVG assets for misc usage: https://undraw.co/illustrations

** App icons are made like this
For i-OS
https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_launcher_icons

For Android
Icons are made with Android Studio, so they look native based on android versions . [[https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive.html][Adaptive icons]]

On android, every size of the splash screen image name
=ic_launcher.png= is just the raw image(same size), just so the icon
splash screen is bigger.

** To get firebase config
*** For Android
First add the fingerprint for the new system to firebase and download
the new google-services.json file Add the projects fingerprint on the
new system using this
https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth

For Android: https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/project/fitness-531/settings/general/android:com.kaipada.fitness_531
- put the =json= file under android/app/google-services.json
  
*** For iOS
Justin download the =.plist= file
https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/fitness-531/settings/general/ios:com.kaipada.fitness531

** Setting up code signing
https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#signing-the-app
** When updating dependencies
If building iOS breaks after updating flutter dependency go to the ios dir and run =pod update=
